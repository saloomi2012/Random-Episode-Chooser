# Random Episode/File Chooser

This simple python script opens a random file in the directory "episodes/". I made this script to open random episodes of the show, "The Office". However, it should work on any file in the directory episodes. 

To use:

-Download script to any location.

-Make a directory called episodes in the same directory as the script.

-Populate the directory with files.

-Run the script.

-Voila!

Note: this script only works on macOS
